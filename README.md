Here are some important things to know about the application.
1)As suggested, the application could be built in plain HTML/CSS as well but I chose to make a native Android Application 
to better help my candidacy as the role is for an Android Developer.
2)There are 3 views     
    No. 1: The view to only select bikes. The user cannot go ahead without selecting at least 1 bike.    
    No. 2: The view to select accessories and Insurance.    
    No. 3: The final checkout page with a details representation of the product costs and quantities along with final cost.
3)The user can only select the quantity of a particular product once he/she clicks on the product.

Working on this project really was a great experience. It made me realize my rusty ends but in the short time span, I believe 
I am happy with the result. Obviously, this application can be improved and other features can be added and the UI enhanced I believe that
the case with every application.
